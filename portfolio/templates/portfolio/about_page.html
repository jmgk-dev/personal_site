			    I’m Jamie, a creative and enthusiastic web developer based in London. My career has included a disparate range of music industry roles, giving me a unique outlook on the digital world and how we incorporate technology and media into our lives.
			</span>

			<span>
			    Working in independent record shops, producing/releasing my own music and then managing a series of iconic UK electronic music labels has helped me learn what’s worthwhile, what works and what doesn’t. I came to realise that the most valuable factor is creativity, and working as a developer gives me the tools I need to make ideas a reality. 
			</span>

			<span>
			    Drawn to the nuts-and-bolts side of development, I focus on <span class="font-weight-bold">Python, Django</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">PostgreSQL</span> to build stable, user-friendly platforms with clear and attractive interfaces. I’m experienced in deploying and maintaining <span class="font-weight-bold">Linux</span> servers hosted with cloud providers, including DigitalOcean and work in team via <span class="font-weight-bold">GitHub</span> projects. Recently I’ve been tailoring a <span class="font-weight-bold">Shopify</span> store for a client and using <span class="font-weight-bold">Spotify’s API</span> to retrieve and analyse data for another.
			</span>

			<span>
			    I’ve worked on a series of freelance projects for clients including <span class="font-weight-bold">Sony Music</span>, digital agency <span class="font-weight-bold">Hactar</span> and independent UK music powerhouse <span class="font-weight-bold">Circus Records</span>. I’m looking forward to taking on more inspiring projects and working with interesting and inspirational people. I look forward to speaking soon!
