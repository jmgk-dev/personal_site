			I’m Jamie, a creative and enthusiastic web developer based in London. My career has included a disparate range of music industry roles, giving me a unique outlook on the digital world and how we incorporate technology and media into our lives.
			</span>

			<span>
			Working in independent record shops, producing/releasing my own music and then managing a series of iconic UK electronic music labels has helped me learn what’s worthwhile, what works and what doesn’t. I came to realise that the most valuable factor is creativity, and working as a developer gives me the tools I need to make ideas a reality. 
			</span>

			<span>
			Drawn to the nuts-and-bolts side of development, I focus on <strong>Python, Django and PostgreSQL</strong> to build stable, user-friendly platforms with clear and attractive interfaces. I’m experienced in deploying and maintaining <strong>Linux</strong> servers hosted with cloud providers, including DigitalOcean and work in team via <strong>GitHub</strong>  projects. Recently I’ve been tailoring a <strong>Shopify</strong> store for a client and using <strong>Spotify’s API</strong> to retrieve and analyse data for another.
			</span>

			<span>
			I’ve worked on a series of freelance projects for clients including <strong>Sony Music</strong>, digital agency <strong>Hactar</strong> and independent UK music powerhouse <strong>Circus Records</strong>. I’m looking forward to taking on more inspiring projects and working with interesting and inspirational people. I look forward to speaking soon!
